## 1. Functions Added to Proc.c

The following functions were added to the proc.c file:

1. `insertProcess(struct redblackTree* tree, struct proc* p)`: Inserts a new process `p` into a red-black tree (`tree`) This function is invoked in critical sections of the operating system, such as during the initialization of the first user process (`userinit`), the creation of a new process (`fork`), yielding the CPU to another process (`yield`), waking up processes from sleep (`wakeup`), and terminating a process (`kill`):
    - `treenode_insertion(struct proc* curProc, struct proc* newProc)`: This is a Depth First Search algorithm function that checks where to insert the new process in the red black tree based on the virtual runtime.
        - `void buddy_createBinaryTreeNode(binary_t **node)`: Allocates memory for the `binary_t` type `treeHead` node of the binary tree. The `offset` field of this `treeHead` will point to the address of the start of the page received from `mmap` in the `buddy_heap` function.
    - `void buddy_find_free(size_t size, void **found, binary_t **node)`: This recursive function finds a node in the binary tree that has enough available memory to allocate to a calling program.
        - `void buddy_split(binary_t **node, binary_t **leftChild, binary_t **rightChild)`: Splits a binary tree node into two other binary tree nodes to accommodate an allocation request when the requested size from the calling program is <= the size of the `binary_t` node.
- `coalesce` function
- `my_malloc` function
- `find_free` function

All the other functions remain untouched. Additionally, I added a function named `findLastNode` which finds the last node of the free list. Instead of using the `mmap` system call to allocate pages from the OS, I used the `sbrk` system call. The reason for this choice is that `sbrk` provides the process with pages contiguous in memory address on each `sbrk` call. For a detailed explanation and visual representation, please refer to the slides linked below. The code for this extension can be found in `my_malloc.h` and `my_malloc.cpp`.

## 2. Binary Buddy Allocator

The second thing I worked on was the Binary Buddy Algorithm. It is a method of memory allocation where available space is repeatedly split into halves, known as buddies. It keeps splitting buddies until it chooses the smallest possible block that can contain the size of memory requested. It allows for easy memory allocation and deallocation, but it requires the unit of space to be a power of two and may result in significant internal fragmentation. The code for this algorithm can be found in `buddy_malloc.h` and `buddy_malloc.cpp`.

In my implementation, I replaced the `node_t` struct in the memory allocator project with a `binary_t` struct, which is used to create a binary tree. Unlike `node_t`, the `binary_t` nodes of the tree have their own designated memory. Initially, the heap available to a program/user is completely empty from top to bottom with no header. The binary tree starts with only one node, the head, which has a `void*` type member called "offset" that points to the address of the start of this heap. The `mmap` system call is made each time a node is created in the binary tree.

I chose this implementation because, as mentioned earlier, each block of memory that is split requires the unit of space to be a power of two, and using `binary_t` headers in the heap for free nodes would not guarantee this.

The implementation consists of two primary functions: one to provide the address of the memory allocated to the user/program and another to free the allocated memory. The interface also includes other functions used for debugging purposes or as helper functions. Most of the functions are recursive and utilize the Depth First Search algorithm to find free nodes in the binary tree.

### Interface

1. `void *buddy_malloc(size_t size)`: Returns a pointer to a region of memory with at least `size` bytes. This function calls the following functions:
    - `binary_t *buddy_heap()`: Returns the head pointer to the binary tree. If the heap has not been allocated yet (treeHead is NULL), it uses `mmap` to allocate a page of memory from the OS, which acts as the heap for the code.
        - `void buddy_createBinaryTreeNode(binary_t **node)`: Allocates memory for the `binary_t` type `treeHead` node of the binary tree. The `offset` field of this `treeHead` will point to the address of the start of the page received from `mmap` in the `buddy_heap` function.
    - `void buddy_find_free(size_t size, void **found, binary_t **node)`: This recursive function finds a node in the binary tree that has enough available memory to allocate to a calling program.
        - `void buddy_split(binary_t **node, binary_t **leftChild, binary_t **rightChild)`: Splits a binary tree node into two other binary tree nodes to accommodate an allocation request when the requested size from the calling program is <= the size of the `binary_t` node.
     
1. `insertProcess(struct redblackTree* tree, struct proc* p)`

### insertProcess Function

The `insertProcess` function is a key component of the xv6 operating system's scheduling mechanism. It is responsible for incorporating a newly created process into a red-black tree (RB tree) data structure used for managing the scheduling of processes. This function takes a pointer to the RB tree and the process to be inserted as parameters.

Internally, `insertProcess` employs the RB tree insertion algorithm to maintain the integrity of the tree's properties. After inserting the process into the RB tree, it ensures that relevant properties of both the tree and the inserted process are appropriately updated. Additionally, it checks for any potential violations of red-black tree rules and performs necessary rotations and recoloring to restore balance.

This function is invoked in critical sections of the operating system, such as during the initialization of the first user process (`userinit`), the creation of a new process (`fork`), yielding the CPU to another process (`yield`), waking up processes from sleep (`wakeup`), and terminating a process (`kill`). By utilizing `insertProcess`, the scheduler effectively manages the execution order of processes, ensuring fair and efficient utilization of system resources.

`insertProcess(struct redblackTree* tree, struct proc* p)`



1. `acquire(&tree->lock)`: Acquires the lock for the RB tree.
2. `tree->root = treenode_insertion(tree->root, p)`: Inserts the process node while maintaining RB tree rules.
3. `updateInsertedProcessandTreeProperties(tree, p)`: Updates properties of the inserted process and the RB tree.
4. `recolorAndRotate(tree, p)`: Checks for RB tree violations and performs necessary rotations and recoloring.
5. `release(&tree->lock)`: Releases the lock for the RB tree.



2. `void buddy_my_free(void *allocated)`: Frees a given region of memory back to the heap. It updates the respective binary tree node accordingly.
    - `void buddy_findTreeNode(size_t size, binary_t *node, void *offset, binary_t **foundNode)`: Recursive depth-first search approach to find the binary tree node whose `offset` field points to the same address as the `offset` parameter.
    - `void buddy_coalesce(binary_t *foundNode)`: This recursive function merges the empty buddies in the binary tree to reduce external fragmentation.

3. `void buddy_print_free_list()`: Recursive function that prints the free list.

4. `size_t buddy_available_memory()`: Calculates the amount of free memory available in the heap.
    - `void freeNodeAndAvailableMemoryHelper(binary_t *node)`: Recursive function that updates a global variable.

5. `int buddy_number_of_free_nodes()`: Returns the number of nodes with available memory in the binary tree.
    - `void freeNodeAndAvailableMemoryHelper(binary_t *node)`: Recursive function that updates a global variable.

6. `void buddy_reset_heap()`: Reallocates the heap.



### More about the Binary Tree created using `binary_t` struct:

- The free nodes in the binary tree will always be leaf nodes, but a leaf node won't necessarily be free if it has been allocated.
- All nodes have an `offset` member which points to an address in the heap available to the user/program.
- When a binary tree node is split, two new nodes are created, and the left and right pointers of the current node point to them.
  - The left child's `offset` points to the same address as the current node's `offset`.
  - The offset of the right child is the current node's `offset` + half of the actual size allocated to this node. For example, if the size of the current node is 1024 and its `offset` member points to 0x0, when this node is split, its left child will have `offset` point to 0x0, and the right child will have an `offset` point to 0x512.
