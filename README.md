## 1. Functions Added to Proc.c

The following functions were added to the proc.c file:

1. `void insertProcess(struct redblackTree* tree, struct proc* p)`: Inserts a new process `p` into a red-black tree (`tree`) This function is invoked in critical sections of the operating system, such as during the initialization of the first user process (`userinit`), the creation of a new process (`fork`), yielding the CPU to another process (`yield`), waking up processes from sleep (`wakeup`), and terminating a process (`kill`):
2. `void treenode_insertion(struct proc* curProc, struct proc* newProc)`: This is a Depth First Search algorithm function that checks where to insert the new process in the red black tree based on the virtual runtime.
3. `void updateInsertedProcessandTreeProperties(struct redblackTree* tree, struct proc* p)`: This function updates the minimum virtual runtime node that `tree->min_vRuntime` points to. It also calculates process weight and total weight calculation of the tree based on the `niceness` value.
## Running the Code

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the zip file.
2. Build the code by running `make`.
3. Execute the command `./allocator_app`.
4. The results for both `my_malloc.cpp` and `buddy_malloc.cpp` will be displayed.
